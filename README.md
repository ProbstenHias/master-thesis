# Implementing Variational Quantum Algorithms as Compositions of Reusable Microservice-based Plugins

This repository holds the written work for my Master's thesis in Computer Science at the University of Stuttgart. The thesis is titled "Implementing Variational Quantum Algorithms as Compositions of Reusable Microservice-based Plugins" and is written in LaTeX.

The work researches how to implement Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) as [RAMPs](https://www.summersoc.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.08-Fabian-Buehler-RAMP-Architecture-SummerSOC-2022.pdf) into the [QHAna](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/qhana) platform. The goal is to create a framework that allows for the easy implementation of VQAs and the reuse of their components while also introducing a new way of plugin interaction and communication.

The source code for the practical part of the thesis can be found as a [PR](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/qhana-plugin-runner/pull/108) to the QHAna-Plugin-Runner repo.

To build the thesis, follow the instructions provided by the used [LaTeX template](https://latextemplates.github.io/scientific-thesis-template/)
The final PDF will be placed in the root of the repository as `main-english.pdf`.
